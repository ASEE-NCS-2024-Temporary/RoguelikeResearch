intro = """Greetings brave adventurer, welcome to Delve the Dungeon!

Congratulations on making your way past the main gate and entering the dungeon itself, I know it was no easy task. 
However, there is no time to catch your breath, as you've alerted the forces of the Grim Reaper, alongside
the various enemies that inhabit this wretched place. 

Having cheated death to make your way inside in the persuit of treasure, the Grim Reaper wishes to claim your soul.
He's not alone either, as he's brought plenty of help to search for you within the dungeon's many floors, and he's
even enlisted the help of those native to this dungeon to trust that you are slain. 

Not only must you scour through the dungeon to find this great treasure, but also search tirelessly to locate and slay 
the Grim Reaper, provided you wish to keep your life. He will stop at nothing to ensure that your existence ends here, 
and the only way to persuade him to stop his attempts on your life are to beat him in a battle of epic proportions!

Rumor has it he awaits your presence on the final floor of the dungeon, as he wishes to test your strength and resolve.
In order to beat him, you'll need to scavenge for weapons and gear from slain travelers and enemies that you discover
along the way, as this is the only way to become powerful enough to stand a chance against him.

Good luck traveler, and may the odds be in your favor. Now go forth and Delve the Dungeon!
